	abstract = {A clamp or grip for heavy duty work with twisted wire cables and the like, such as in marine and industrial uses and especially where reasonably easy application of the cable grip to the cable is important and undue bending moments on the heavy cables are to be avoided. The feature of a removable jaw is coupled with dual link bar structure for the jaws without sacrificing strength and with a considerable reduction in overall weight of the clamp as compared to presently available equipment, this being accomplished in part by elimination of a frame as such and providing the principal jaw with a slotted stabilizing arm having a sliding connection with a unique hanger bar, which latter is designed to be connected to the lift hook of a crane or the like.},
